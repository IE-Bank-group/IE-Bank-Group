    <h1>Scrum Methodology</h1>

    <p>As the Product Owner for the IE Bank app, the Scrum methodology has been adopted in an approach specifically to ensure high-quality product delivery. I have provided all specific practices and ceremonies that have been implemented during this time.</p>

    <h2>1. Scrum Framework</h2>
    <p>The Scrum framework is used to manage the overview development process for the IE Bank app, enabling collaboration and as much transparency with all the team members, to ensure everyone is on the same track.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Product Owner:</strong> Responsible for developing the vision/mission statements as well as sprint backlog prioritization and all documentation.</li>
                <li><strong>Scrum Team:</strong> Includes full-stack developers, cloud architects, site reliability engineers, infrastructure engineers, and cybersecurity engineers.</li>
            </ul>
