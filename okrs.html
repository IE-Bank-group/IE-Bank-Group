    <h1>Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)</h1>
    <p>
        The following OKRs are designed to guide the development and launch of the MVP for the IE Bank app over the next quarter. 
        Each objective supports critical aspects of the project, from user satisfaction to operational efficiency and security.
    </p>

    <h2>Objective 1: Improve User Satisfaction</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>KR 1:</strong> Achieve a 90% satisfaction rating based on post-launch user surveys within the first quarter.</li>
        <li><strong>KR 2:</strong> Complete usability testing with a 90% task success rate, ensuring users can use the app easily.</li>
        <li><strong>KR 3:</strong> Increase active user retention by 25% by providing an easy and engaging user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>KR 4:</strong> Resolve 90% of user-reported issues within a week of reporting to maintain user trust and satisfaction.</li>
        <li><strong>KR 5:</strong> Implement a user feedback loop, achieving a 70% response rate to ensure ongoing improvements based on real user insights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Objective 2: Strengthen Security and Data Protection</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>KR 1:</strong> Ensure 100% of user passwords are stored as securely hashed.</li>
        <li><strong>KR 2:</strong> Conduct security testing to identify and resolve at least 95% of critical issues before deployment.</li>
        <li><strong>KR 3:</strong> Achieve a 100% pass rate for all authentication and authorization tests to prevent any unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>KR 4:</strong> Make sure all team members have knowledge of the best security practices.</li>
        <li><strong>KR 5:</strong> Set up automated monitoring for user login attempts to detect and block suspicious activity, with a response time of under 5 minutes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Objective 3: Enhance Operational Efficiency in Development and Deployment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>KR 1:</strong> Implement a CI/CD pipeline with automated builds and deployments, achieving a 90% reduction in manual deployment tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>KR 2:</strong> Complete each sprint on schedule with at least 95% of planned tasks marked as “done.”</li>
        <li><strong>KR 3:</strong> Automate 80% of test cases for continuous integration, minimizing testing time while ensuring quality.</li>
        <li><strong>KR 4:</strong> Reduce code review and approval time by 50% through streamlined GitHub workflows and team collaboration.</li>
        <li><strong>KR 5:</strong> Maintain an average issue resolution time of under 48 hours to keep development on track.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Objective 4: Increase Product Stability and Reliability</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>KR 1:</strong> Achieve 99.9% uptime in the development and UAT environments, with production aiming for the same reliability standard post-launch.</li>
        <li><strong>KR 2:</strong> Conduct load testing to confirm that the system can handle at least 1,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.</li>
        <li><strong>KR 3:</strong> Resolve 95% of critical bugs reported during testing within 72 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>KR 4:</strong> Achieve an average response time of under 2 seconds for all major application functions (login, account viewing, money transfers).</li>
        <li><strong>KR 5:</strong> Complete two rounds of end-to-end testing with a pass rate of at least 98% to ensure platform stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Objective 5: Build a Good Product Knowledge Base</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>KR 1:</strong> Create a complete user manual covering all MVP features and functionalities by the end of the project.</li>
        <li><strong>KR 2:</strong> Document 100% of API endpoints, including usage, parameters, and response formats, to support developers.</li>
        <li><strong>KR 3:</strong> Publish detailed troubleshooting guidlines for at least 10 common user issues which then reduces support requests post-launch.</li>
        <li><strong>KR 4:</strong> Ensure the knowledge base is accessible and user-friendly.</li>
        <li><strong>KR 5:</strong> Implement a system for automatically updating the knowledge base when code changes are merged, making sure 100% alignment with the latest application features.</li>
    </ul>
