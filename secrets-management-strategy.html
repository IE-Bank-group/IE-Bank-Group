    <title>Secret Management Strategy</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
        In order to manage our <strong>credentails</strong> securely, we decided to leverage Azure Key Vault for storing sensitive <strong>informations</strong> such as usernames, passwords, and deployment tokens. We have separate resource groups for development (dev), user acceptance testing (UAT), and production (prod) <strong>enviroments</strong>. This segmentation ensures that each environment has its own set of <strong>credentails</strong>, which adds an extra layer of security and prevents any accidental mixing of secrets between <strong>differnt</strong> stages of deployment.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, in the apayne-kv-dev Key Vault, we securely store <strong>secret</strong> such as the Container Registry credentials (username and <strong>password</strong>) and the Static Web App Deployment Token for the frontend. These secrets are critical because they <strong>enables</strong> our systems to securely connect to the Azure Container Registry and deploy the frontend to the appropriate <strong>enviroment</strong>. Without these credentials, our deployment process would be <strong>interupted</strong>, which is why itâ€™s crucial to ensure these secrets are never exposed in code or pushed into GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Container Registry <strong>credentails</strong> (both username and passwords) are needed for accessing and pushing images to our Azure Container Registry. This is particularly <strong>importnat</strong> as it ensures that only authorized systems or users can upload or pull container images, protecting our <strong>infrastrcture</strong> from unauthorized access.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Static Web App Deployment Token is another important <strong>credentials</strong> we store in the Key Vault. This token allows the frontend application to be <strong>deploy</strong> to the appropriate Azure static web app. Without this token, deployment would fail, disrupting our <strong>continuos</strong> integration and deployment pipeline.
    </p>
    <p>
        As we have divided our resources across dev, UAT, and prod <strong>enviroments</strong>, storing these secrets separately for each <strong>enviroment</strong> allows us to manage access with greater <strong>precission</strong>. For example, different users may have access to the development secrets, but they would not have access to the production <strong>credentails</strong>. This segmentation helps ensure that production secrets are well guarded and are not accessible by those working on development or testing <strong>enviroments</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In <strong>summarry</strong>, securely managing <strong>credentails</strong> through Azure Key Vault is an essential practice to ensure the safety of our deployment pipelines. By storing all sensitive information in the Key Vault and managing them per <strong>enviroment</strong> (dev, UAT, prod), we are enhancing the security of our operations and preventing any accidental leaks or exposures.
